!path lib/*.jar

Run script that is defined behind command.MAGICSCRIPT property in config.properties
it returns first argument as the return code. 
|com.capgemini.fitnesseplugin.commandlinefixture.CommandLineFixture|                                                   
| runCommand | MAGICSCRIPT 0 0_is_the_return_value |

!define returnCode {20}
this time, command returns exit code as ${returnCode},  that I also expected
