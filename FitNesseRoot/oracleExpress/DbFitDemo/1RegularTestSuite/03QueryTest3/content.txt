#Encrypt utility that ships with DbFit to encrypt the password.
#Encrypt is provided both as a shell script (encrypt.sh) and a Windows batch file (encrypt.bat)

#1. Encrypt your password: encrypt.sh your-password-here
#2. A new keystore is created when encrypt is invoked for the first time--> $HOME/.dbfit.jks
#3. Copy the encrypted string ( ENC(jzDH1fYetwCp3JFfAeKebA==) ) into the database connection (string or file). 
#4. No change is needed in the DbFit tests - the ConnectUsingFile and Connect fixtures work with both encrypted and non-encrypted passwords
