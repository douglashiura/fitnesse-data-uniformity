!define WAIT_TIMEOUT {5}

Since all actions should fail, this test must be ran manually. Besides each command should take at least ${WAIT_TIMEOUT} seconds to complete, not desirable for CI.

The expected result of this test is the following:
- ensure that each actions tries ${WAIT_TIMEOUT} seconds to complete before failing
- ensure that check failures show the difference of expected and obtained values.
- ensure that inputing elements throws the exception indicating the element to input was not found.
- optionally test stop test on first failure
