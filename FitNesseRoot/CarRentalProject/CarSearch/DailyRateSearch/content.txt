Story:

As a user I want to be able to search for a car within a given price range.  The results should return in ascending order.


Tests: 

First, prime the database with known cars.

!|Initialize with cars|
| vin | description | dailyRate |

| acura1 | 1998 Acura RL | 4500 |
| lexus1 | 2005 Lexus LS430 | 15500 |

Verify that I can find car within price range
!|query: show cars in price range|2000 to 7000|
| vin    | description       | daily rate |

Verify that no cars returned if not within price range
!|query: show cars in price range|1000 to 1300|
